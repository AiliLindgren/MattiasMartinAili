            <h2>Round ping pong</h2>

            <h3>About</h3>

            <p>
                Round ping pong is a sociable form of table tennis, where you run around the table and hit the ball once
                per turn. If you miss, you're out or you will get a dot depending on the rules you have agreed on. When
                there is only two people left, these two are faced in a final showdown. The serve must be hit diagonally
                and land in the opposite square on the other side of the table. For the best flow, its recommended that
                players run counter-clockwise (why you ask? No idea). Most of the hits are therefore fore hand, since
                the majority of people are right handed. If you are left handed a good back hand is to prefer, like
                Kims. If you're a beginner or just really bad you can also get one
                extra serve. But if the player miss this one as well, he/she gets a dot and the next player serves
                instead.
