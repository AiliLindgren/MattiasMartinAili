                        <p>
                            Table tennis, also known as ping-pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a
                            lightweight
                            ball
                            back and forth across a table using small rackets. The game takes place on a hard table
                            divided
                            by a
                            net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a
                            ball
                            played
                            toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it
                            bounces
                            on the
                            opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within
                            the
                            rules.
                            Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits
                            an
                            opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.

                            Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation
                            (ITTF),
                            founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations. The table tennis official
                            rules are
                            specified in the ITTF handbook. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, with
                            several
                            event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's
                            doubles
                            and
                            women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.

                        <p>
                            Round ping pong is a sociable form of table tennis, where you run around the table and hit
                            the
                            ball once
                            per turn. If you miss, you're out or you will get a dot depending on the rules you have
                            agreed
                            on. When
                            there is only two people left, these two are faced in a final showdown. The serve must be
                            hit
                            diagonally
                            and land in the opposite square on the other side of the table. For the best flow, its
                            recommended that
                            players run counter-clockwise (why you ask? No idea). Most of the hits are therefore fore
                            hand,
                            since
                            the majority of people are right handed. If you are left handed a good back hand is to
                            prefer,
                            like
                            Kims. If you're a beginner or just really bad you can also get one
                            extra serve. But if the player miss this one as well, he/she gets a dot and the next player
                            serves
                            instead.
